# Bankist website, the marketing platform for Bankist App

This website advertises the Bankist App in a beautiful way.

**How does it work?**

- It starts with establishing going green and going digital.
- Next, there are features which conveys the uniqueness of the Bankist App.
- Below features, it mentions all things a user can do if he/she uses this App.
- To seal the deal, there are testimonials of active users.
- In the header and the footer, there is a button to open new account.

**Key Features**

- Pop-Up window (to open bank account)
- Slider component (to display testimonials)
- Tabbed Component (to display features of App in an ordered list)
- UX/UI (smooth scrolling, hovering effects, lazy loading images, sticky navigation, and revealing sections on scroll)

**Things learnt**

- _Create Pop-up windows_ : used JS to add and remove HTML classes in order to manipulate CSS properties of HTML elements.
- _Event Delegation_ : instead of adding event handlers to every button inside a particular area, we can add one handler to the whole area and define actions by fetching the location of click. This keeps our code very clean.
- _Intersection Observer API_ : an alternative to using scroll events. Used to apply sticky navigation, lazy loading images and revealing sections on scroll. In simple words, it allows us to observe, track and act everytime we scroll.
- _Sliding window effect_ : converted an unordered list into a sliding window by simply putting them side by side by changing their X-coordinates to multiples of 100. To make it functional, everytime a user clicks on the slide button, their X-coordinate changes.

**Imp Skills**

- APIs
- `bind` method
- `closest` method
- DOM Manipulation
- event listeners and handler functions
- gaurd clause
- `new IntersectionObserver(callback, options)`
- refactoring Code
- `target` method
